### Whoami

Hi, I'm Jonhnny Weslley. I am a passionate full-stack developer with [14+ years of strong experience](https://jonhnnyweslley.net/resume) in web development with a willingness to make great products.

I developed my career at [Credishop][], where I had the opportunity to build a great team in order to bring more value to the products developed. I use mentorship strategies to find the best in my team, inspire them to achieve, aid them in their pursuit of personal growth.

Previously I worked with systems for storing and processing distributed data and received an MSc in Distributed Systems from Universidade Federal de Campina Grande. It was an amazing experience, I learned a lot and make great friends.

I am an open-source evangelist and sometimes I work on open-source stuff in my spare time. Check out my [repositories][] to see what I'm currently up to. Nowadays I am focused on pushing new skills to my stack: [machine learning][].

If you're interested, check out my [blog][] to [see what I'm doing now](https://jonhnnyweslley.net/now).
